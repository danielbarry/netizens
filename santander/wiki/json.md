# JSON

## Introduction

We use JSON because of it's simplicity and wide-support. As well as being nicer to view than some languages such as XML, some features such as arrays can also make JSON a much more appropriate choice.

## Submodule

We currently use a simple version of JSON, where a few simple packages are offered allowing for objects and arrays. These allow us to easily use and write the data in JSON files.

## JSON in UI

We use JSON to define the visuals in the UI by specifying how elements behave depending on values given relative to the displays current width and height.
